% dxdt = rb_reaction_wheel (time, x, flag, ext_torque, tinerb, tinerbinv, rw_torque, rw_iner)
%   rb_reaction_wheel returns with the time derivative of the dinamic
%   equations of a rigid bod attached to 3 reaction wheels
% inputs:
%   time
%       Time (s)
%   x
%       Attitude state vector: quaternions (4), angular velocity (rad/s) (3),
%       wheel's angular momentum (3)
%   flag
%       See ODEFILE
%   ext_torque
%       External torques acting on the spacecraft (Nm) including control 
%       and unmodelled disturbances. Vector(3)
%   tinerb
%       Inertia matrix (kg*m*m) of the non-rotating mass, equal to the
%       difference between the total satellite inertia (including wheels) 
%       and the reaction wheel's rotating mass.
%       tinerb = inertia - rw_iner*identity(3,3). Matrix(3,3)
%   tinerbinv
%       Inverse of the tinerb inertia matrix (1/kg*m*m). Matrix(3,3)
%   rw_torque
%       Torque to be applied to the reaction wheels (Nm). Vector(3)
% outputs:
%   dxdt      
%       State vector time derivatives
